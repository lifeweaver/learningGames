# Learning how to make games

Each branch is a new game I'm learning to make in order to learn certain concepts, see https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/your-first-step-to-game-development-starts-here-r2976/

Basically:

    Pong = Simple: input, physics, collision detection, sound; scoring
    Worm = Placement of random powerups, handling of screen boundaries, worm data structure
    Breakout = Lessons of pong, powerups, maps (brick arrangements)
    Missile Command = targeting; simple enemy ai, movement, and sound
    Space Invaders = simple movement for player and enemy, very similar to breakout with the exception that the enemy constantly moves downward, simple sound
    Asteroids = asteroids (enemies) and player can move in all directions, asteroids appear and move randomly, simple sound
    Tetris = block design, clearing the lines, scoring, simple animation
    Pac Man = simple animation, input, collision detection, maps (level design), ai
    Ikari Warriors = top down view, enemy ai, powerups, scoring, collision detection, maps (level design), input, sound, boss ai
    Super Mario Bros = lessons of Ikari Warriors (except with side-view instead of top-down view), acceleration, jumping, platforms

I used the tutorials on https://www.gamedevelopment.blog/full-libgdx-game-tutorial-flgt-home/ to make the orginal pong clone. 

Every later brach includes the previous game, there is a menu with the list of games.
