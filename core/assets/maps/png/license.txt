Paid Assets License
Alright, let's make it short and easy to understand:

    Personal or commercial use (paid games, with ads, freemium, whatever)
    Bought assets may can be used in unlimited numbers of product or game title.
    Game published on multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Steam, etc) counted as single game title. No need separate license for each platforms.
    For your own project or on behalf of a client
    There’s no limit to the number of copies, sales, or downloads of a game created using any bought items
    The items cannot be sublicensed, resold, shared, transferred, or otherwise redistributed on its own (even for free)
    You can modify the items as you like but for your end product only. You can't sell, share, or distribute the derivative work as an stock item
    It's not necessary to put my name or this site link on your game's credit page. But if you do that, I'll be more than happy. :D



Free Assets License
For the game assets in Freebies section, it's under Creative Common Zero (CC0) a.k.a Public Domain license.

So, basically you can:

    Use it on your commercial or non-commercial projects, whether it's an end product, templates, course materials, or whatever you name it.
    Unlimited usage, there's no hidden cost & royalties.​
    ​Not necessary to put my name or this site link. But I won't stop you if you do that. :p
